# Sample_bits

I am uploading bits of everything i have learned from past few days which include the following:-

- Performing Linear Regression on any given data set.
- Pyspark and using there transformation.
- Kafka theory and sending and recieving messages through it locally from producer and consumer.
- Cassandra Database and how it works and it's related architecture for supporting NoSQL.

For Linear Regression:

Created a simple notebook piece to read the car details and then finally predict the selling price of the car by training the models from the features provided.

Code file -
Linear Regression (Multiple using categorical features).py

For Pyspark, Kafka and cassandra:

Created a pyspark script which reads data from kafka producer in terminal as json and then writes the streaming data to the console.
I tried integrating cassandra so that write happens there, it worked but showing some errors recently, so fixing it.

Along with it prepared Proper Notes for all the above topics.

Next in Line:-
Currenly studying about the Sentiment Analysis and how it works and trying to create a project to read user data from api and use all above tech stack along with machine learning to predict the nature of sentiment.
